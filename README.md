# Beard Wizard üéØ

## Basic Details

### Project Description
Beard Wizard is an AI-powered web application that acts as a "magic mirror" for beard grooming. Using a live webcam feed, it overlays precise, real-time cutting guides for various beard styles directly onto your face, ensuring a perfectly symmetrical trim every time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The crippling anxiety of an uneven beard trim. Every year, millions of men face the mirror, trimmer in hand, only to emerge with a lopsided monstrosity. The emotional toll is immeasurable, leading to a global crisis of confidence and an over-reliance on expensive barbers.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've weaponized AI and computer vision to fight back. Beard Wizard streams a live video of your face from your Django server, runs it through a sophisticated Python/OpenCV backend, and draws the perfect beard outline for you to follow. It's like having a tiny, digital barber living in your computer, guiding your every move.
