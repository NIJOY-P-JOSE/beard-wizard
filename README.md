Project Description
Beard Wizard is a cutting-edge, AI-powered virtual try-on application. It uses your webcam to accurately map your face and lets you preview different beard styles in real-time, helping you make life's most important decisions without the commitment of actually growing hair.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The modern world suffers from a critical epidemic of "beard regret." Countless hours and resources are wasted growing beards that just don't match one's face, leading to existential dread and a sudden urge to buy a fedora. We needed to stop this crisis.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a "time machine" for your face. By harnessing the power of advanced AI and a sprinkle of web magic, Beard Wizard allows you to see your bearded future, today. It's a risk-free environment for facial hair exploration, saving humanity from questionable grooming choices one virtual beard at a time.

Technical Details

Diagrams
Our highly technical workflow: The user opens the page, JavaScript accesses the webcam, MediaPipe finds the face, and our code draws a glorious beard on it. The Django backend just serves the initial page and enjoys the show.

For Hardware:

Schematic & Circuit
Not Applicable - Our project is purely software-based and requires no custom hardware.

Build Photos
Not Applicable - Our build process involved more caffeine than solder.

Project Demo
